# Welcome to the Analyzing Web Archives Workshop

This 'book' is an asynchronous version of our live, Analyzing Web Archives workshop. This book includes narrative as well as code chunks, interactive pieces of code that you can run in your browser without having to install anything on your machine. 

This asynchronous workshop includes 3 parts: 
* an introduction to web archives
* an introduction to the dataset
* exploring a dataset using Python
