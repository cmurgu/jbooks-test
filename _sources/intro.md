# Welcome to the Analyzing Web Archives Workshop

This 'book' is an asynchronous version of our live, Analyzing Web Archives workshop. This book includes narrative as well as code chunks, interactive pieces of code that you can run in your browser without having to install anything on your machine. 

This asynchronous workshop includes 3 parts: 
* an introduction to web archives
* an introduction to the dataset
* exploring a dataset using Python

The workshop is facilitated by Tim Ribaric and Cal Murgu, librarians at Brock University.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to
* describe the technical process of archiving and reloading preserved websites 
* explain how web archive collections can be analyzed computationally
* complete basic analysis of web archive datasets using Google Colab and Python

## How to use this 'book'

This workshop uses a combination of *narrative text chunks* and *code chunks*. The difference is important.
